# Understanding-Flask
Using Flask to create simple application and have them rendered on the server side.  
In order to understand basic concepts of creating applications and rendering them on servers, I used Flask in order to create a simple event application.
Explored concept such as HTTP methods; GET and POST. Understanding what they are, what they do, how to use it, when to use it. 
Little bit of bootstrap, I much prefer using my own custom CSS styles.
